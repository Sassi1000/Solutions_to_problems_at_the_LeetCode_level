A list of integers is called an "ordered list" if all even values ​​(if any) are at the beginning
The list and all the odd values ​​(if any) are after them, at the end of the list.
for example:
The following lists are "ordered" lists:
lst1 = [6, 24, 12, 8, 44, 3, 7]
lst2 = [6, 24, 12, 8, 16, 22]
The first function receives a list of integers arr.
 The operation will return a True value, if the list is "ordered" and not, the operation will return a False value.
 
The second function receives three parameters of integer type: size, x, y.
 The operation should create an ordered list of integers of size filled with random numbers
 Between x and y (inclusive).
 
 It can be assumed that 0<size and y<x as well.
